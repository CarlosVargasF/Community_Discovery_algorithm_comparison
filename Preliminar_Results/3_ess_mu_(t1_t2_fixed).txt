Testing LFR Bchmk by varying mu [0.1 - 1] with t1=2.18, t2 = 1.02 

mu = 0.10 -------------------------------------------
          t1 = 2.18, t2 = 1.02 -> Failed: Could not assign communities; try increasing min_community
mu = 0.20 -------------------------------------------
          t1 = 2.18, t2 = 1.02 -> Failed: Could not assign communities; try increasing min_community
mu = 0.30 -------------------------------------------
          t1 = 2.18, t2 = 1.02 -> Failed: Could not assign communities; try increasing min_community
mu = 0.40 -------------------------------------------
          t1 = 2.18, t2 = 1.02 -> Failed: Could not assign communities; try increasing min_community
mu = 0.50 -------------------------------------------
          t1 = 2.18, t2 = 1.02 -> Succeded
